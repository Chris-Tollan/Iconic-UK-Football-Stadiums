## Design

#### Colour Scheme

- There are three main colours used in this project - black green and white, this links the page to the two main colours (black and white) often used to portray the image of a football. Football fans often describe matches played in the evening as having a "special" atmosphere, the colour scheme of the site keeps in line with this as black representing the evening and white representing the stadium lighting. A green background with white writing will be used throughout for areas of text, this keeps in line with the football theme with green representing the grass of the pitch and white in this case representing the the lines on the pitch.

#### Typography

- The Lora font will be used for headers consisgtently throughout the website with the Playfair Display font being used for all other text. Both fonts are attractive, clean and compliment each other well which will provide for a good user experience. Sans serif will be used throughout as a back up font.

#### Imagery

- The background image is a stock image of fans celebrating within a stadium. This image is striking and has been selected as the background image to captivate the user immediately.
- The images for the stadium page will be an aerial side profile image which will capture the entirity of each stadium.
- The images for the gallery page will consist of four for each stadium, outside of stadium, inside the stadium and images from well known spots of the stadium.

### Wireframing

- I initially drew my ideas onto a notepad and discussed these ideas along with how I intended to keep the website responsive to different devices and also user friendly with my mentor. I thereafter used Balsamiq to help me further visualise the ideas I had for this website.
- After I had decided on the layout for the homepage I decided to keep this consistent throughout the entire website which would consist of the navigation bar at the top, background image, content then at the bottom would be the footer.
