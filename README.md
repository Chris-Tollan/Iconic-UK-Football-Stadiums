### Wireframing

- I initially drew my ideas onto a notepad and discussed these ideas along with how I intended to keep the website responsive to different devices and also user friendly with my mentor. I thereafter used Balsamiq to help me further visualise the ideas I had for this website.
- After I had decided on the layout for the homepage I decided to keep this consistent throughout the entire website which would consist of the navigation bar at the top, background image, content then at the bottom would be the footer.

## Features

- The background color for the website will be black and text will be white. Apart from the fact white obviously pops and contrasts with black which will make all text on the webiste stand out and be easy to read the colors were also chosen as alot of vintage footballs were made of black and white leather patches. It is also the opinion of alot of football fans that nothing beats visiting a stadium a night and watching a game "under the lights", the colors of black and white keep with this theme.
