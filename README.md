### Wireframing

- I initially drew my ideas onto a notepad and discussed these ideas, along with how I intended to keep the website responsive to different devices and also user friendly with my mentor. I thereafter used Balsamiq to help me further visualise the ideas I had for this website.
- After I had decided on the layouit for the homepage I decided to keep this consistent throughout the entire website which would consist of the navigation bar at the top, background image, content then at the bottom would be the footer.
