## Design

#### Colour Scheme

- The main main colours used are black and white, this links the page to the two main colours often used to portray the of a football. Football fans often describe matches played in the evening as having a "special" atmosphere, the colour scheme of the site keeps in line with this as black representing the evening and white representing the stadium lighting.

#### Typography


#### Imagery


### Wireframing

- I initially drew my ideas onto a notepad and discussed these ideas along with how I intended to keep the website responsive to different devices and also user friendly with my mentor. I thereafter used Balsamiq to help me further visualise the ideas I had for this website.
- After I had decided on the layout for the homepage I decided to keep this consistent throughout the entire website which would consist of the navigation bar at the top, background image, content then at the bottom would be the footer.
